description: Thumbnail of a photograph of a young Burmese boy has his head shaved
  by an older monk as part of a Shinbyu ceremony. This ritual novice hood initiation
  occurs before a boy enters a monastery, as is custom in Myanmar for boys between
  the ages of 10 and 20. (Courtesy of Dietmar Temps on Flickr. CC BY-NC-SA 2.0.)
